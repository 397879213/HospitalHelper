Project: HospitalHelper!

Demo Instructions:

1. Make sure there exists a database “cpsc_408” accessible on localhost port 3308
2. Ensure there is a folder called “assets” with the file “demographic_data.csv” and “specific_data.csv” in it (the first one is created by Faker, from DataGenerator.php, and the second was created from an online tool). The “assets” folder should be the working directory for the project.
3. Ensure there is a folder called “schemas” in the “assets” folder with all these names:
    condition_mysql.sql
    creditcards.sql
    doctor_data_view.sql
    doctor_mysql.sql
    doctor_patient_mysql.sql
    hospital_data_view.sql
    hospitals.sql
    location_mysql.sql
    patient_data_view.sql
    patient_mysql.sql
    patient_phone_mysql.sql
    prescriptions_mysql.sql
4. Ensure there is “commons-csv-1.1.jar” in the folder as well, compiled on project compilation. It will be used for exporting CSV files.
5. Run! It will create tables and generate data for you.

I used Java Swing Documentation and SQL Documentation extensively.
